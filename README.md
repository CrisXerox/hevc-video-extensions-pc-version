## Description:

Play High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) videos in any video app on your Windows 10 device. 
These extensions are designed to take advantage of hardware capabilities on some newer devices‚Äî including those 
with an Intel 7th Generation Core processor and newer GPU to support 4K and Ultra HD content. 
For devices that don‚Äôt have hardware support for HEVC videos, software support is provided, 
but the playback experience might vary based on the video resolution and PC performance. 
These extensions also let you encode HEVC content on devices that don‚Äôt have a hardware-based video encoder.
